⁸· The way and means thereto is, first, to examine your lives and
conversations ht the rule of God's commandments, and wherein soever
ye shall perceive yourselves to have offended, either by will. word or
deed, there to bewail your own sinfulness, and to confess yourselves to
Almtgkty God with full purpose of amendment of life,- and ifye shall

¹ perceive your offences to be such as are not onir against God. but also

against your netghbors. then ye shall reconcile yourselves unto them,
being reaay to make restt'tution and satis-sathon accordi to tke utter-
most of your power, sor all injuries and wrongs done you to any
other, and being likewise ready to forgive others that have offendedyou‚
as ye would havesor iveness of your offences o God’s hand ,· for other-
wise the receiving· o the Ιιοζγ communion dot nothing else but increase
your damnation. herefore tf any of you be a blasphemer of God, a
henderer or slanderer qs His word, an adulterer, or be in malice or
emor, or in any other grievous crime, repent you os your st'ns, or else
come not to the hoiy Table,· lest after the taking qs that holy sacrament
tlte devil enter into you, as be entered into Zudas, and fill you with all
iniquities, and bring you to destruction bot of body and soul.”

Hic ne quidem nominatur fides, sed solum docentur opera,
ex causa quia illa sunt ex Verbo, et non simul ex doc-
trina. Etiam Fides Athanasiana, quae in ecclesia illa
saepe quotannis in festis coram populo legitur, ac recepta
est, quia e Concilio, ut communis doctrina de Trinitate in
omnibus ecclesiis ChristianiS, ¹¹1docet haec de Domin0‚ ac
de ultimo judicio ab Ipso :—

⁸⁴ All rnen shall ive account for their own works: and they that
have done good ska go into lese everlastitgr, and they that have done

evil into everlastirg fire. T lais is tlte Catholic saith, whtch except
a man believe satthsully, ke cannot be saved.”

Attende nunc, reflecte et explora, numne illi qui tam in-
geniose ex doctrina praedicant, aut similia credunt, inclua
dunt talia fidei sicut recondita in illa: et quia credunt
quod opera non¹¹³justificent, et quod nemo possit facere
bonum a se quod est bonum, et quod bonum ab homine
sactum in se meritum habeat, omittunt facere, et credunt
quod per reconditam vitam in sola fide, hoc est, in fide
separata a bonis operibuS, salventur. Sed contestari pos-
sum, quod illi qui ita credunt et simul ita vivunt, omnes
in infernum veniant; at illi qui secundum praecepta in
oratione praeparatoria ad Sanctam Cenam, et secundum
Fidei Athanasianae ultima dicta, vivunt, in caelum veni-
ant; hi etiam fidem habent, illi autem non habent, utcun-
que putent quod habeant. Dicitur, qui ex doHrina credunt
et simul vivunt, quia plures, imprimis simpliciores, ex doc·
